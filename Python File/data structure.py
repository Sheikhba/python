""" data structures and algorithms """

"""
Data Structures = different ways of storing data on your computer
you can store things in list like format

Algorithims = operations on different data structures + sets of instructions for executing them
"""


""" Arrays and Memory """

"""
Array is a colection of items of a single type e.g.
[5, -2, 300, 20] < an array of integers
["yeahhh", "ouch", "haha"] < an array of string
["chhh", 3, 2, 1, "ohhh"] < not usuale to have multiple mix data type  
"""
"""
2 ways of storing data on your computer
memory(RAM) < temporary < easier to accses easy read and write
storage < pernament < reading and writing dat from and to storage in slow
"""


""" classes and objects """

"""
classes 
A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables)
and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods)
you can make objects with classes
e.g
             Class
               \/
Robot  name
       color 
       weight
       introduceself() 
      
objects is a colection of properties whic can be expresed as verible and function
object can repesent somthing
An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings
e.g
          object
            \/
    --------------\
r1 |  name "tom"  |
   |  color "red" |- instance verible / attributes 
   |  weight 30   |
   |______________/
     introduceself()> function / methods

""" linked lists """
"""
array can be visulized as a long box with many partitions

linked list can be visulised as many boxes conected together
each boxes in linked list can be repersented as a object - more info about class and object look previous section

linked list = storing colection of items - differint from an array

recursion = a way of solving a problem by having a function call itself

""" Big O Notation and Time Complexity """

"""
These helps you to describe

            /\
            \/

time it takes to run your function will grow
                     /\
when the size of your input grows (to your function)
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk&index=7&list=PLBZBJbE_rGRV8D7XZ08LK6z-4zPoWzu5H

runtime = time it takes to execute a piece of code

time complexity = a way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of the input increases

time complexity|Big O Notation
---------------------------------
linear time    = O(n) - n is the size of the input
constant time  = O(1)
quadratic time = O(n squared)

express differient type of time complexity in more of a systimatical way is big O Notation
